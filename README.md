**OBJECT DETECTION PROJECT**

This project demonstrates object detection using the MobileNet-SSD model, a pre-trained deep learning model capable of detecting multiple objects in an image. 
It utilizes OpenCV for image processing and the DNN module for performing detection.

**Features**
Detects and classifies objects in an image with bounding boxes.
Uses the MobileNet-SSD pre-trained model.
Implements a simple and efficient deep learning approach for object detection.
Displays results with bounding boxes and labels on the input image.

**Getting Started**

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2) library
NumPy library
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-detection-project.git
cd object-detection-project
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy opencv-python
Download the model files:

MobileNet-SSD Prototxt file
MobileNet-SSD Caffemodel file
Place these files in the project directory.

**Usage**
Add an image for object detection (e.g., img_2.png) to the project directory.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python object_detection.py
The script will display the image with detected objects marked by bounding boxes and labels.
How It Works
Model Setup:
The project uses the MobileNet-SSD model, which combines a lightweight architecture with accurate object detection capabilities. The model reads the .prototxt and .caffemodel files to initialize.

Image Preprocessing:

The input image is resized to 300x300 pixels.
A blob is created to normalize the image for the model.
Object Detection:

The pre-trained model detects objects and outputs their class labels and confidence scores.
Bounding boxes are drawn around detected objects with confidence above a threshold (50%).
Display Results:

Detected objects are shown with green bounding boxes and blue labels.
Example
Input Image:

Output Image:
<img src="example_output.jpg" alt="Output Image" width="400">
